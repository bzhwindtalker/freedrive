Open foil assist design based on multiple iterations and community feedback

# freedrive

This project details the development of a lightweight, DIY electric hydrofoil assist system. The primary goal is to create a minimal and efficient setup to aid in getting on foil for downwinding and pumping, rather than a full-power e-foil experience. The complete development log can be found on the [foil.zone forum thread](https://foil.zone/t/light-assist-season-3/24787).

## System Features

The design prioritizes a streamlined, integrated, and lightweight system, with a focus on reliability and serviceability.

*   **Design Concept:** A minimal "light assist" system, conceptually similar to the Flite AMP or foildrive assist slim, designed for pump, surf, and downwind assistance. The system is not intended to be a full-power eFoil.
*   **Integrated Pod:** An under-board, 3D-printed pod houses the battery and electronics for reduced drag and a clean setup. The design allows for the pod to be swappable to experiment with different motor options.
*   **Battery Configuration:** The system is designed for a 12S1P 21700 battery pack, with the option to use a larger 12S2P pack for extended use.
*   **Motor Controller:** The system is managed by a VESC-based electronic speed controller.
*   **Validated Propulsion:** The project utilizes custom 3D-printed components, including a successfully tested 3D-printed aluminum propeller that has been in use since January 2025, with a 6384 120KV motor.

### On-Board Setup (Season 2)
This image shows the integrated pod from the previous version of the project, mounted on a custom board.

### CAD and Layout (Season 3)
The latest version focuses on a compact internal layout and a clean cutout for board integration.

## Project Status

**Active Development:** The project is currently in its third major iteration ("Season 3"). As of the latest update, parts including the VESC and receiver have been ordered, and significant CAD work has been completed. The goal is to create a reliable and serviceable system, saving as much weight as possible while meeting the project objectives.

**Community Engagement:** Design files for a previous version ("Season 2") of the setup were shared with approximately 15 people, resulting in at least two known successful community builds.
