# Freedrive: Open Foil Assist

An open-source, DIY project to build a lightweight electric hydrofoil assist, based on multiple iterations and community feedback.

## System Characteristics

The system is built around a VESC-based controller and has been proven with a 6384 120KV motor and a custom 3D-printed aluminum propeller that's been in use since January 2025.

| Feature | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **System** | 12S |
| **Battery Current** | 50A |
| **Phase Current** | 125A - 150A |
| **Power** | ~2200W (with 6384 120KV motor) |
| **Weight** | ~2.8kg (controller, pod, and battery) |
| **Expected Starts**| 10 to 15 (highly dependent on rider, foil, & board) |
| **Standard Battery**| 12S1P 21700 pack |
| **Assist +1 battery cost**| ~650€ |

## Scope

This project is for a lightweight electric hydrofoil assist. Think of it as a small, clean boost to help get on foil for downwinding, flat-water pumping, catching micro-swells, and wake thieving.

It is **not** a full-power e-foil. The goal is a minimal, efficient setup similar to commercial systems like the Flite AMP or Foil Drive Assist. The core of the design is a slim (25mm thick) 3D-printed pod that sits under the board and houses the battery and electronics, keeping drag low for a clean setup.

## Project Status

*   **Active Development**: The project is in its fourth major version ("Season 3"). The primary goals are improving reliability, making it easier to service, and shaving off as much weight as possible.
*   **Community Validated**: The V2 design was validated by the community. Design files were shared with about 15 people, leading to at least two known successful builds.
*   **V4 system** With the updates included in the V4 system, now is the best time to get start building your own, as the project has hit a good maturity state.

## Planned Evolutions

*   **More Juice**: A larger 12S2P battery pack is being developed for longer sessions or for a more beginner-friendly setup.
*   **Weight Reduction**: The swappable pod design makes it easy to experiment with different motors and props to find even lighter combinations.
*    **Flight/solderless battery**: Battery that can be assembled from individual 21700 cells and this airplane safe (disassemble for flight, assemble when landed).

## Limitations

*   **Not travel freindly**: 12S1P of 21700 is above 160 wh allowed for airplane transport. No travel battery solution has been designed so far.
*   **Low range**: If your use case involves a lot of motoring around, the 12S1P will be very limited. Same if your weight is above 90kgs, the system has not been tested with heavier riders so far.
*   **DIY project**: Even if the project is supposed to have a good level of documentation, it remains a hobby project, so expect to have to figure out certain things. The battery need a custom build and can not be bought off the shelf AFAIK.
*   **DANGER**: A propeller under the board is not to be taken lightly. Mishandling, technical error or user error can cause dangerous situations that could lead to severe ingury. Not kidding, we all had some close calls.
*   **No warranty**: This is a DIY project, that goes into the water (saltwater too). Bad things can happen, due to technical issues, wear and tear, user error. Support will be provided without any reply, service or delay garantee.
